This is my final project for the Foundations unit of TOP. It is intended to demonstrate my entire range of skills so far in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I did the extra credit task of adding a backspace button.

*Extra credit if I ever get bored*
1) add a "." button for decimals
    -add to dom
    -add styles to classes in css
    -make sure to disable button if there's already a decimal in the display
2) add keyboard capability
    -(make sure nothing happens/it doesn't crash if other nonrelevant keys are pressed?)
